#  Bot Battlr
## This is a simple toy display app
### **By Whitney Shisia**
#### description
Welcome to **Bot Battlr**, the one and only spot in the known universe where you
can custom build your own Bot Army! This is our app:


## Setup

After unbundling the project:

1. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
2. Run `npm run server`. This will run your backend on port `8002`.
3. In a new terminal, run `npm start`. This will run your React app on port `8000`.

Make sure to open [http://localhost:8002/bots](http://localhost:8002/bots) in
the browser to verify that your backend is working before you proceed!

The base URL for your backend is: `http://localhost:8002`

## Live link
Deployed Frontend can be accessed here (https://magnificent-gnome-e36274.netlify.app/)
Deployed Backend can be accessed here [APP](https://code-2-bdtj.onrender.com/bots/https://code-2-bdtj.onrender.com/bots/)



## Core Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should
  render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
  The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.
- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
  `YourBotArmy` component.
- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.

### Endpoints for Core Deliverables

## Advanced Deliverables

These deliverables are not required to pass the code challenge, but if you have
the extra time, or even after the code challenge, they are a great way to
stretch your skills.

> Note: If you are going to attempt these advanced deliverables, please be sure
> to have a working commit with all the Core Deliverables first!

As a user, I should be able to:

- Choose if I want to enlist a bot into my army or just see their data. Clicking
  on the card should instead display a show view (`BotSpecs`) for that bot,
  which should replace `BotsCollection`. BotSpecs should have two buttons: one
  to go back to the list view and another to enlist that bot. Your app could
  look like the following:

- Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component,
  `SortBar`.
- When I enlist a bot it will be **removed** from the `BotCollection` and added
  to `YourBotArmy`.
- Filter bots by their class. We can select a few filters at the same time.
- Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component,
  `SortBar`.
- Only enlist **one** bot from each `bot_class`. The classes are
  `["Support", "Medic", "Assault", "Defender", "Captain", "Witch"]`.
